Meant as an exercise in arrays as well as malloc.

zoi.c prompts user for circumference values in mm. The assumption is these values are being obtained from 'zones of inhibition' on a petri
dish. 

There is currently a const value of 5 for petri dishes which can easily be changed. There is currently no limit on the amount of values per dish. 
In a real world situation, you'd not place so many samples that the zones of inhibition would come into contact with one another.
